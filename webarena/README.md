# install
## can get pretty far using:
```bash
conda env create -f webarena.yaml
```

## maybe want to install playwright separately
```bash
playwright install
``` 
## try running

```bash
python minimal_example.py
```
## make sure to run 

```
python setup.py --install
```

# notes 
## setting to headless mode (required on server)
might want to set `headless=True` in `minimal_example.py`
